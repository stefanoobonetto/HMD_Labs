Some parameters are on the meta device device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
 Given the input JSON, the NLU component has identified the following slots with null values:

* ham_on_top
* egg
* mushrooms
* spring_onion
* bamboo_shoots
* carrots
* seaweed

Based on the above, I will generate the following actions:

* request_info(ham_on_top)
* request_info(egg)
* request_info(mushrooms)
* request_info(spring_onion)
* request_info(bamboo_shoots)
* request_info(carrots)
* request_info(seaweed)

These actions will prompt the user to provide the missing information for each slot.
